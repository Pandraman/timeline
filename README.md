# WIKIPEDIA TIMELINE

This is a timeline made from wikipedias list of "on this day".

### How to use
To use, just run the .bat file. Then you can use tags to search for something.
For example:
**_rome roman_** will return a list of of every element in the timeline that contains either "rome" or "roman".

### Saving to a file
Saving to a file saves the list into ***results/***.
The file can then be read as a **.txt**.
