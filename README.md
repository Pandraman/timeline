WIKIPEDIA TIMELINE

This is a timeline made from wikipedias list of "on this day".
To use, just run the .bat file. Then you can use tags to search for something.
For example:
"rome roman" will return a list of of every element in the timeline that contains either "rome" or "roman".
Saving to a file saves the list into "results/".
